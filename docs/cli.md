# CLI

The CLI uses the same engine as the browser UI.

```bash
npm run analyze
npm run analyze -- examples/demo-bundle.json
npm run analyze -- examples/demo-bundle.json --pack
npm run analyze -- examples/demo-bundle.json examples/cli/observed-runs.json
npm run compile:traces
npm run compile:traces -- examples/traces/approved-support-traces.json
npm run compile:traces -- examples/traces/approved-support-traces.json --pack
```

Flags:

- `--json` prints the full analysis object.
- `--pack` prints the generated pack payload.
- no flag prints the markdown report.

Typical terminal-first flow:

1. Save a harness bundle as JSON.
2. Run `npm run analyze -- <bundle.json>`.
3. Inspect whether `intent`, `contract`, and `benchmark` are explicit in the source pack.
4. Inspect visible vs holdout gaps directly in the terminal.
5. Export the pack if you want to share it with another teammate or CI job.

Typical trace compiler flow:

1. Save approved traces as JSON.
2. Run `npm run compile:traces -- <trace-corpus.json>`.
3. Review the generated `intent`, `contract`, and `benchmark` draft.
4. Promote the approved draft into your benchmark source of truth before running wrapper mutations.

Docker workflow:

1. Build the image with `npm run docker:build`.
2. Run it with `docker run --rm -p 8088:80 harnessamp:local`.
3. Use the container when you want the production build rather than Vite dev mode.
